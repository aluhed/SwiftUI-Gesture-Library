Overview
The library is designed for iOS developers, UX designers, and interaction advocates. It brings together traditional SwiftUI gestures with a set of custom gestures that respond to complex input patterns. It supports gesture chaining, so you can combine multiple gestures to trigger specific states or actions. It also ships with a library of haptic patterns that can be paired with gesture events to reinforce interactions through touch.

This project aims to be practical and approachable. It favors clear APIs, fast feedback, and predictable behavior. It is built to scale—from a simple tap-and-respond interaction to a multi-step gesture sequence that powers advanced UI flows. The library emphasizes accessibility, so designers can include gestures that work well with VoiceOver, larger hit areas, and adaptive interaction patterns.

What you get
- A toolkit of 30+ custom gestures, with room to grow
- Easy composition via gesture chaining and sequencing
- A flexible haptic engine with ready-to-use patterns
- Accessibility-friendly gestures and modifiers
- Solid Swift Package Manager integration for easy adoption in iOS apps
- Clear examples and recipes to accelerate development
- Extensible architecture that supports new gestures and patterns

Getting started
Prerequisites
- Xcode 14 or newer
- iOS 13.0+ as a minimum deployment target
- Swift 5.x
- Swift Package Manager (SPM) as the preferred integration method

Installation
The recommended way to include this library in your project is through Swift Package Manager. You can add the package to your Xcode project using the URL below and picking the latest release tag or a version range that fits your app’s needs.

Swift Package Manager steps (illustrative)
- Open your Xcode project
- Choose File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency
- Enter the package URL: https://github.com/aluhed/SwiftUI-Gesture-Library.git
- Select the version you want (e.g., from 1.0.0)
- Add the library to your target

Usage patterns
SwiftUI Gesture Library provides both its own gesture types and adapters that work with native SwiftUI gestures. You can mix and match to create robust interactions that feel natural on iOS devices.

Minimal example
The following example demonstrates a simple tap gesture that updates a label and triggers a haptic cue.

Code example (illustrative)
import SwiftUI
import SwiftUIGestureLibrary

struct ContentView: View {
  @State private var message: String = "Awaiting interaction"
  @State private var count: Int = 0

  var body: some View {
    VStack(spacing: 20) {
      Circle()
        .fill(Color.blue)
        .frame(width: 120, height: 120)
        .gesture(LibraryTapGesture(count: 1) { // custom library gesture
          count += 1
          message = "Tapped \(count) time(s)"
        })
      Text(message)
        .font(.title2)
        .padding()
    }
    .padding()
  }
}

Notes
- This example uses a hypothetical LibraryTapGesture to illustrate how the API could look. The actual API may differ, but the pattern remains intuitive: attach a library gesture to a SwiftUI view and handle events in closures.

Composite gestures and chaining
One of the core strengths of the library is composing gestures. You can chain multiple gestures to create nuanced interactions. For example, you can require a drag followed by a short hold to trigger a mode switch, or a double tap with a specific velocity to unlock a feature.

Code example (illustrative)
import SwiftUI
import SwiftUIGestureLibrary

struct ComplexInteractionView: View {
  @State private var mode: String = "Idle"

  var body: some View {
    Rectangle()
      .fill(mode == "Active" ? Color.green : Color.red)
      .frame(width: 180, height: 180)
      .libraryGestures([
        .sequence([
          .doubleTap { mode = "Active" },
          .drag { translation in
            // Update UI based on drag translation
          },
          .hold(minimumDuration: 0.4) { /* finalize action */ }
        ])
      ])
  }
}

Accessibility and UX design
The library includes a dedicated set of accessibility gestures and modifiers. These are designed to be discoverable by assistive technologies and to work well with dynamic type, high-contrast modes, and VoiceOver. You can map common accessibility actions to gesture sequences or provide alternative patterns for users who rely on gestures with larger hit targets.

Haptic patterns
Haptic feedback reinforces gesture events. The library ships with a collection of patterns suitable for various contexts: subtle confirmations, corrective cues, success alerts, and progress indicators. Each pattern can be tuned for intensity and duration, and you can attach a pattern to a gesture event or trigger it independently when needed.

Architecture and design
Core concepts
- Gesture definitions: A set of gesture types that describe how input is recognized.
- Gesture composition: A builder that allows combining gestures into sequences, parallel patterns, or conditional flows.
- Event handlers: Closures that run when a gesture is recognized or when a gesture state changes.
- Haptic engine: A module that selects and triggers tactile feedback based on gesture events.
- Accessibility layer: Abstractions to map gestures to accessible actions and hints.

Code organization
- Core: The gesture engine and the primitives used to define and recognize gestures.
- Adapters: Bridges between native SwiftUI gestures and the library’s custom gestures.
- Haptics: A standalone module for managing haptic feedback patterns.
- Accessibility: Helpers to expose gestures to assistive technologies.
- Examples: A gallery of practical usage patterns and recipes.
- Tests: A suite of unit and UI tests to validate gesture behavior.

Extensibility
The library is designed to be extended. You can add new gesture definitions by:
- Defining recognition rules
- Providing a corresponding event handler
- Registering the gesture in a catalog so it can be discovered and used in code samples

Best practices for building your own gestures
- Start with a clear interaction goal. Every gesture should map to a meaningful user action.
- Consider accessibility from day one. Provide alternative patterns, larger hit targets, and simple discovery cues.
- Favor deterministic timing. Avoid long or unpredictable delays that frustrate users.
- Use consistent feedback. Haptic cues should align with the gesture’s meaning.
- Document edge cases. Gesture recognition can be sensitive to motion and device variation.

Accessibility and inclusive design
- Hit targets: Gestures should be usable on devices with varied screen sizes. Default hit areas should be large enough for comfortable interaction.
- VoiceOver: Provide descriptive hints for gestures so VoiceOver users can learn the pattern and purpose.
- Customizable thresholds: Let designers adjust recognition thresholds to suit accessibility needs.
- Visual cues: Offer optional visual feedback for gesture states to aid users who benefit from non-audio cues.
- Alternate patterns: Provide simpler or alternative gestures that achieve the same outcome.

Haptic patterns in detail
- Confirm: A short, crisp cue for a successful action.
- Subtle: A light vibration for minor updates.
- Alert: A sharper cue for errors or warnings.
- Rhythm: A sequence of taps that communicates a progress state.
- Customizable: Developers can tune intensity, duration, and repeat count to fit the app’s tone.

Customization and configuration
- Thresholds: Adjust the sensitivity of recognition to reduce false positives.
- Timing: Set minimum and maximum durations for gesture activation.
- Haptics: Choose from predefined patterns or craft custom ones.
- Visual feedback: Enable or disable overlay hints and micro-animations.
- Localization: Gesture hints can be localized for different languages and regions.

Testing and quality
- Unit tests: Validate the recognition logic, sequencing, and edge cases.
- UI tests: Simulate gestures and verify UI state changes.
- Performance: Measure gesture recognition latency and ensure it stays within acceptable bounds on target devices.
- Accessibility checks: Verify that gestures are discoverable and usable with assistive tech.

Examples and recipes
- Simple tap branch
- Double-tap with acceleration
- Drag then release to trigger an action
- Long-press with a hold-to-activate pattern
- Complex sequence with conditional branches
- Accessibility-friendly alternatives
- Haptic-driven feedback loop

Code samples (illustrative)
These snippets illustrate the kinds of usage you might implement with the library. The exact API may differ slightly depending on the version you adopt. Use the library’s official docs as the canonical reference.

Example 1: Simple tap and haptic feedback
import SwiftUI
import SwiftUIGestureLibrary

struct TapFeedbackView: View {
  @State private var taps = 0

  var body: some View {
    Rectangle()
      .fill(Color.accentColor)
      .frame(width: 200, height: 200)
      .libraryGesture(.tap { taps += 1; Haptics.feedback(.success) })
      .overlay(Text("Tap me: \(taps)").foregroundColor(.white))
  }
}

Example 2: Drag sequence with visual state
import SwiftUI
import SwiftUIGestureLibrary

struct DragSequenceView: View {
  @State private var offset: CGSize = .zero
  @State private var completed = false

  var body: some View {
    Circle()
      .fill(completed ? Color.green : Color.orange)
      .frame(width: 100, height: 100)
      .offset(offset)
      .libraryGesture(.sequence([
        .drag { delta in offset = delta },
        .dragEnd { _ in
          completed = true
          Haptics.feedback(.success)
        }
      ]))
  }
}

Example 3: Accessibility-first gesture
import SwiftUI
import SwiftUIGestureLibrary

struct AccessibilityGestureView: View {
  @State private var status = "Waiting"

  var body: some View {
    VStack(spacing: 16) {
      Image(systemName: "hand.tap.fill")
        .resizable()
        .frame(width: 120, height: 120)
        .foregroundColor(.primary)
      Text(status)
        .font(.title2)
    }
    .libraryGesture(.accessiblePattern { action in
      status = action.description
    })
    .accessibilityLabel("Gesture preview")
    .accessibilityHint("Perform the accessibility gesture to trigger an action")
  }
}

A note about usage and integration
- Plan your gesture strategy early in the UX design process. Map core interactions to a small, stable set of gestures that are easy to discover.
- Consider device variability. Gestures can behave differently on different devices; design for tolerance and provide sensible defaults.
- Use haptics thoughtfully. Align tactile feedback with the action’s meaning and avoid overuse that can feel noisy or intrusive.
- Keep the app responsive. Gestures should trigger UI updates quickly and smoothly to maintain a good feel.
